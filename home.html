                    Jarvis is built using Python, integrating speech recognition for listening to user commands and text-to-speech for responding in a natural-sounding voice. The assistant's capabilities are driven by Python libraries such as pyttsx3 for speech synthesis, speech_recognition for processing audio commands, and various APIs for real-time tasks like weather updates and web searches.
                    <br><br>
                    1. Voice Commands: Jarvis listens for keywords and phrases, interpreting commands like "What's the weather in New York?", "Set an alarm for 7 AM", or "Open YouTube." <br> <br>
                    2. Real-Time Responses: Once a command is detected, Jarvis processes it and delivers an appropriate response, either by speaking it aloud or performing the requested action. <br> <br>
                    3. Customizability: One of the key features of Jarvis is its flexibility. You can add new commands and integrate it with other platforms to extend its functionality as you see fit.

                    This project demonstrates the integration of Python with web development technologies to create an interactive, voice-responsive web page. Here’s a breakdown of the key technologies used: <br><br>
                    1. Python: The backend programming language used for processing the voice commands and generating the assistant's responses. <br> <br>
                    2. Speech Recognition: Python's speech_recognition library is used to convert voice input into text that can be processed. <br> <br>
                    3. Text-to-Speech: The pyttsx3 library allows Jarvis to speak responses aloud, providing a more immersive experience. <br> <br>
                    4. Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to build the front-end of the page, providing a user-friendly interface. <br> <br>
                    5.APIs: External APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap for weather updates and Wikipedia for information retrieval, are integrated into the assistant's functionality.
